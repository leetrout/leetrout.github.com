      <description>Episode Zero is the preview of what is to come in the Fish Tales podcast.
I explain some of the motivations for starting the show and give credit to my inspiration and those who have helped me.
I am excited to share the stories I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered and I hope you stick around and tune to enjoy them!</description>

      <description>In this episode we explore Ange&amp;rsquo;s background, how he got started programming and how the engine simulator came about. Of particular interest to me was how it went viral and the pressures that surfaced. This episode kicked off the podcast recording in late 2022 and I really cannot thank Ange enough for investing the time to record with me with no idea what this podcast is or would be or when it would even be published.</description>

      <description>Greg is a long time friend, first time caller and he&amp;rsquo;s here to tell us about his career and the work he has done in 3D animation. He tells us all about working on AAA titles including Civilization V and how he transitioned to teaching at ETSU. I am certain you can&amp;rsquo;t make it through this episode without laughing and smiling as you listen to Greg tell his entertaining and interesting stories.</description>
