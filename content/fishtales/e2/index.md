Greg is a long time friend, first time caller and he's here to tell us about his
career and the work he has done in 3D animation. He tells us all about working
on AAA titles including Civilization V and how he transitioned to teaching at
ETSU. I am certain you can't make it through this episode without laughing and
smiling as you listen to Greg tell his entertaining and interesting stories.
Greg, thanks for a fantastic episode!
