So I show up to All Things Open '22 and in the first session of the community
leadership summit I see a fella in a purple teletubby costume. It happened to be
Halloween and this fella was none other than Josh Goldberg. I had a blast at the
conference, thoroughly enjoyed the time I got to spend with Josh and attending
his talk and it was truly an honor to get so much of Josh's time to record this
episode. Gather round and listen to us talk about All Things Open, open source
development, writing and publishing a technical book and so much more.

Josh, thanks again for investing the time to record this episode! I enjoyed
editing it as much as I enjoyed recording it!
