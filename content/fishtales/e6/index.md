I met Adam Allred back in 2016 and we've kept in touch over the years. He's
currently a Senior Staff Engineer at Mailchimp. Join us for a chat about all
sorts of tech subjects as well as Adam's background. Adam is one of those unique
individuals that makes you feel smarter just by listening to them and it was a
treat to record this. Adam, thanks again for the conversation!
