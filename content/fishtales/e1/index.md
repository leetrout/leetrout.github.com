In this episode we explore Ange's background, how he got started programming and how the engine simulator came about. Of particular interest to me was how it went viral and the pressures that surfaced. This episode kicked off the podcast recording in late 2022 and I really cannot thank Ange enough for investing the time to record with me with no idea what this podcast is or would be or when it would even be published.
