Haroun is a principal software engineer and sound engineer. We had a great chat
about his background in sound engineering and some of the artists he's worked
with over the years before diving into our opinions on various aspects of
software engineering. Haroun is one of those people that will always leave you
wanting to learn more as he has such a broad knowledge base that covers so many
topics. I am certain there's something interesting here for everyone.

Haroun, thank you for making the music for the show and thanks for all the great
conversations in addition to this one we captured to share with the world!
