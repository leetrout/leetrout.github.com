Alvin is a release engineering manager at HashiCorp and we met back before the
pandemic in 2020. In this episode we explore Alvin's past from sledding on
cafeteria trays to working on data center tech to what he does day to day at
work. We nerd out a bit on infrastucture management, tooling, developer
experience and more!

Alvin it was a blast to reconnect and record this conversation! Thank you!
